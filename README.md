# PV-nRT
# Ideal Gas Simulator
This repository contains a Python program that simulates a system of ideal gas particles bouncing around in a box.

# Features

 * Visualizes ideal gas particles in a 2D box.
 * Simulates elastic collisions between particles.
 * Allows customization of particle number, speed, and visual appearance.
# Dependencies

* pygame (https://www.pygame.org/)

# Running the Simulation
* Clone the repository.
* Install the required dependencies: `pip install pygame`
* Run the script: `python simulate.py`
* This will launch the simulation window and display the particles moving around.

# Perks
* Fully random, unscripted
* Bond formation: Sometimes two or three molecules combine.
